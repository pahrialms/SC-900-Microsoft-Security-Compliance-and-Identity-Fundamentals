# Lab: Explore sensitivity labels in Microsoft Purview

This lab maps to the following Learn content:

- Learning Path: Describe the capabilities of Microsoft compliance
- Module: Describe information protection and data lifecycle management in Microsoft Purview
- Unit: Describe sensitivity labels

## Lab scenario

In this lab, you'll explore the capabilities of sensitivity labels.  You'll go through the settings for existing sensitivity labels that have been created and the corresponding policy to publish the label.   Then you'll see how to apply a label and the impact of that label, from the perspective of a user.

**Estimated Time**: 20-25 minutes

### Task 1

In this task, you'll gain an understanding of what sensitivity labels can do by going through the settings for an existing sensitivity label that have been created and the corresponding policy to publish the label.

1. Open the browser tab for home page of Microsoft Purview.  If you previously closed it, open a browser tab and enter **https://admin.microsoft.com**. Sign in with the admin credentials for the Microsoft 365 tenant provided by the authorized lab hoster (ALH). From the left navigation pane of the Microsoft 365 admin center, select **Show all** then select **Compliance**.  A new browser page opens to the welcome page of the Microsoft Purview compliance portal.   

1. In the left navigation panel, under solutions, expand **Information protection** then select **Overview**.
    1. On the overview page, you may see a yellow information box indicating that your organization has not turned on the ability to process content in Office online files that have encrypted sensitivity labels applied and are stored in OneDrive and SharePoint.  Select **Turn on now**.  Once you do this, there can be a delay for the setting to propagate through the system.

1. From the left navigation panel, select **Labels**.

1. Some labels have been preconfigured in your Microsoft 365 lab tenant, for your convenience. Select **Confidential - Finance**.  A window opens that provides information about this label.  Note how this label is set to support both encryption and content marking.  Select the **pencil icon** at the top of the page to view some of the basic configuration settings.
    1. Configuration starts with providing a name and description for your label.  Don’t change anything.  Select **Next** at the bottom of the page.
    1. Note the scope for this label.  The scope is set to Files & emails.  Don’t change anything.  Select **Next** at the bottom of the page.
    1. This next screen is where you can choose protection settings for the labeled items. Note that this label is configured to support encryption and content marking. Don’t change anything.  Select **Next** at the bottom of the page.
        1. The Encryption window shows the configuration for the encryption settings. Review the current settings, but don’t change anything. Notice how the user access to content is set to never expire.  You can also assign permissions to specific users and groups so only they can interact with content that has this label applied.  Under users and groups, the tenant is defined so all users in your tenant can view content that has this label.  The finance team is also listed and they have co-author permissions.  Don’t change any settings.  Select **Next** on the bottom of the page.
        1. On the content markings page, take note of the information box on the top of the page.  Content markings will be applied to documents but only headers and footers will be applied to email messages. In other words, watermarks are not applied to emails.  The content marking associated with this label is a watermark.  Don’t change any settings.  Select **Next** on the bottom of the page.
    1. You are now in the Auto-labeling for files and emails window.  Read the description of auto-labeling on the top of the page and the information box below it.  Also take note that this label is set for auto-labeling for specific conditions. Don’t change any settings.  Select **Next** on the bottom of the page.
    1. This next window defines protection settings for teams, groups, and sites that have this label applied. This is not enabled, select **Next** on the bottom of the page.
    1. This next window is a preview feature to automatically apply this label to schematized data assets in Microsoft Purview Data Map (such as SQL, Synapse, and more) that contain the sensitive info types you choose.  This feature is not enabled. Select **Cancel** at the bottom of the page to exit the label configuration wizard and return to the Information Protection page.

1. From the left navigation panel, select **Label policies**.  It is through label policies that sensitivity labels can be published.  The Microsoft 365 tenant has been configured with some label policies, for your convenience.

1. In this case, Select **Confidential-Finance Policy**.  A window opens that provides information about the policy.  Note the description, this label policy has been setup to serve as the default sensitivity label policy for all users and groups. This policy serves to publish most of the labels that were preconfigured for this Microsoft 365 lab tenant and are listed in the labels tab.  

1. Select **Edit** policy from the top of the window.
    1. Read the description under “Choose sensitivity labels to publish”.  Notice the labels that are listed.  Don’t change any settings.  Select **Next** on the bottom of the page.
    1. The next page is a preview for Assigning admin units, review the description for admin units. The admin units are set to the full directory, don't change any settings. Select **Next**.  
    1. Read the description under “Publish to users and groups”.  Notice this label is available to all users.  Don’t change any settings.  Select **Next** on the bottom of the page.
    1. Review the policy settings.  Select **Next** on the bottom of the page.

    1. Review the policy settings. Since nothing was changed select **Cancel** to return to the Label policies page.

1. From the Information protection page, select Auto-labeling. Review the description. Note that you create auto-labeling policies to automatically apply sensitivity labels to email messages or OneDrive and SharePoint files that contain sensitive info. No auto-label policies have been preconfigured in our tenant. To create a new auto-label policy, select **Create auto-label policy**.  Here you will walk through the steps to create a new policy.

### Review

In this lab, you'll explore the capabilities of sensitivity labels.  You'll go through the settings for existing sensitivity labels that have already been created and the corresponding policy to publish the label.   Then you'll see how to apply a label and the impact of that label, from the perspective of a user.
